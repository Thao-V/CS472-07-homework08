### Create two subclasses, `Car` and `Motorcycle`, that inherit from the `Vehicle` class. The Car class should have an additional property called `numDoors` to represent the number of doors, and the `Motorcycle` class should have an additional property called `numWheels` to represent the number of wheels.

### Implement the following methods for each subclass:

1. Car:

* openTrunk() - Log a message indicating that the trunk has been opened.
Motorcycle:

* popWheelie() - Log a message indicating that a wheelie has been popped.
### Create instances of `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and demonstrate the inheritance and functionality of each class by calling their methods.
